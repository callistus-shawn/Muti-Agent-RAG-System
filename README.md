# Muti-Agent-RAG-System

* Engineered a LangGraph-based system with multiple agents that dynamically decide between document retrieval and web search using LLM-driven reasoning based on query context and content relevance.

* Integrated FastAPI for PDF upload and question handling, with document parsing, embedding, and similarity search; implemented intelligent fallback from document context to web tools when information was insufficient.
